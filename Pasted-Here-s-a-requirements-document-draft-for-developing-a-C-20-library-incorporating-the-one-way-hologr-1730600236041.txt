# Requirements Document for One-Way Holographic Hash Library

## Project Overview
The project aims to develop a C++20 library providing a one-way holographic hash function with an emergent, recursive nonce mechanism for high-security cryptographic applications. The library will support context-sensitive key generation using dynamically evolving nonces derived from system or content states. This design will deliver a highly secure, adaptive keychain suited to gamified or dynamic encryption contexts.

## Key Features
1. **One-Way Holographic Hash Function**
   - A non-invertible hashing algorithm that incorporates input data with unique session parameters (e.g., IP addresses, content hash, metadata).
   - Produces a holographic-like hash, where each fragment contains partial information about the whole but is unusable without the complete context.
   - Sensitivity to slight changes in input, preventing successful brute-force attacks from different contexts or sessions.

2. **Recursive Emergent Nonce Generation**
   - Nonce generated based on system state, IPs, or content metadata, updating dynamically per session or encryption stage.
   - Recursive chaining of nonces, where each new nonce depends on the previous state, building an adaptive cryptographic chain that evolves with content and usage.
   - Self-healing properties, where partial data recovery is possible based on the recursive chain.

3. **Dynamic Keychain Management**
   - Context-sensitive keys that incorporate the recursive nonce and the one-way holographic hash.
   - Each key is unique to the session and usage context, providing forward secrecy.
   - Secure rollback and event-based updates for state-dependent key continuity.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. One-Way Holographic Hash Function
- **Function Signature**: `std::string holographic_hash(const std::string& input, const SessionParams& params);`
  - **Inputs**:
    - `input`: The raw data to be hashed.
    - `params`: Struct containing session-specific parameters (e.g., source IP, destination IP, session metadata).
  - **Outputs**:
    - Returns a unique, holographic-like hash string.
  - **Behavior**:
    - Hash should be one-way, non-invertible, and sensitive to all components of `params`.
    - Hashing algorithm should create a “holographic” effect where fragments contain information about the whole.

- **Session Parameters Struct** (`SessionParams`)
  - Struct to hold metadata for context-specific hashing, including:
    - Source IP, destination IP, and additional metadata as required.
    - Nonce (updated at each iteration).

### 2. Recursive Emergent Nonce Generation
- **Function Signature**: `Nonce generate_emergent_nonce(const std::string& input, const SystemState& state);`
  - **Inputs**:
    - `input`: Current content or data to be hashed.
    - `state`: Struct describing system or content state (e.g., content hash, CPU load, network stats).
  - **Outputs**:
    - A `Nonce` object representing the emergent nonce.
  - **Behavior**:
    - Generate a nonce that adapts to content or system states.
    - Updates recursively, depending on previous nonce values and current state, forming a self-referential chain.

- **System State Struct** (`SystemState`)
  - Struct to hold metadata relevant to nonce generation, such as:
    - Content hash, CPU load, network conditions, timestamp.
    - Previous nonce (for recursive chaining).

### 3. Keychain Management
- **Function Signature**: `std::string generate_key(const std::string& input, const SessionParams& params, const SystemState& state);`
  - **Inputs**:
    - `input`: Raw data for encryption.
    - `params`: Session parameters for context-specific hashing.
    - `state`: System state to derive emergent nonce.
  - **Outputs**:
    - Returns a session-specific encryption key derived from the holographic hash and nonce.
  - **Behavior**:
    - Combines holographic hash and recursive nonce into a unique, session-dependent encryption key.
    - Allows for secure rollback, with each key retaining sensitivity to the exact session parameters.

### 4. Secure Rollback and Anti-Replay Mechanism
- **Function Signature**: `bool validate_key(const std::string& key, const SessionParams& params, const SystemState& state);`
  - **Inputs**:
    - `key`: Key to validate.
    - `params`: Session parameters.
    - `state`: System state.
  - **Outputs**:
    - Boolean indicating whether the key is valid for the current session and state.
  - **Behavior**:
    - Prevents reusing keys across sessions or states.
    - Ensures forward secrecy and resistance to replay attacks.

### 5. Error Handling and Logging
- The library should log critical errors, such as invalid nonce states or key mismatches, to help in debugging and testing.
- All error conditions should trigger exceptions with meaningful error messages.

## Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Performance**
   - The library should be efficient, minimizing overhead from hashing and nonce generation processes.
   - Recursive nonce updates and key generation should execute within real-time constraints.

2. **Scalability**
   - Support multiple concurrent sessions without conflicts in nonce or key generation.
   - Ensure efficient resource usage to scale across distributed systems.

3. **Security**
   - Cryptographic components must follow best practices for secure hashing and key management.
   - Resist brute-force and replay attacks by ensuring that all keys are context-sensitive.

4. **Compatibility**
   - C++20 standard compliance, with compatibility across common platforms (Linux, Windows, macOS).
   - Minimize dependencies to ensure portability and ease of integration.

5. **Testing**
   - Unit tests for each function, verifying correctness and edge cases.
   - Security tests for brute-force resistance, replay prevention, and forward secrecy.
   - Performance benchmarks to assess efficiency under varying system loads.

## API Documentation and Usage Guide

1. **Code Documentation**
   - Each function should include concise, clear documentation on usage, inputs, outputs, and exceptions.
   - Brief explanations of any key algorithms or cryptographic techniques used.

2. **Usage Guide**
   - Provide example code for integrating the library, including:
     - Basic key generation and validation.
     - Handling rollback and updating nonces.
   - Include guidance for configuring session parameters and system state.

## Milestones

2. **Phase 2: Keychain Management and Validation**
   - Implement key generation, secure rollback, and anti-replay validation.

3. **Phase 3: Testing and Documentation**
